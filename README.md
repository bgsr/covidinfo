# covidinfo
I created a  covid-19 informative webpage . I used HTML, CSS, AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNTS, STATIC WEB APPS for this project.
In this webpage you can book appointment and also you can get the doctors detials
And you can get the symptoms and precautions for covid-19.
I used storage accounts for storing the source code in a container and static web apps to host the webpage.
